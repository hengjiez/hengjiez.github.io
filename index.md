## About Me

I am a full-time researcher/engineer at Huawei's theory lab. Before joining Huawei, I completed my Ph.D. from Columbia University, where I was co-advised by <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~andoni/" rel="noopener"> Alexandr Andoni</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~omri/" rel="noopener"> Omri Weinstein</a>, and <a href="https://joshalman.com//" rel="noopener"> Josh Alman</a>.

I graduated from Yao Class at Tsinghua University in June 2019. In spring semester 2018, I visited University of Michigan and worked with <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~pettie/" rel="noopener"> Seth Pettie</a>.
